<h1>Explore the World and Lore of Reia</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Learn about the existence of the Ethereals, your story, and the various Cities and Realms of this world.</h2>

## The Ethereals <!-- [#ethereals] -->

### What are the Ethereals? <!-- [#ethereal-info] -->

The <a href="/explore/ethereals">Ethereals</a> are the deities of this world. They govern their own realms and occupants, should they have any. Depending on the nature of the Ethereal, they may even go to war with other realms. Some of the youngest known Ethereals are Reia and her siblings. Her sister, who hasn't been named, and her brothers, Urik and Tacitus. These four Ethereals were created by the merging of their parents' realms.

#### Reia

Reia was born with a natural affinity for all types of elements in the ether. Because of her extraordinary gift to use any element she wants, she is the only Ethereal that can use two elements at once. Her world is surrounded by an exceptionally diverse culture ranging from different elements, races, and other affiliations! But not all is good in her realm. Reia has spent her whole life practicing all of them to the degree that allows the occupants of her realm to also have a bit of her specialty in a sense.

#### Urik

Urik, one of Reia's brothers, is the instigator that influenced Reia's siblings in a devious way to invade Reia's realm. He has a low affinity with using elements. But that doesn't stop him. His specialty comes from his proficiency with obtaining knowledge. His entire realm is based off of soulless occupants that are machines or made from ores and minerals. Urik's proclivity with such vast knowledge has enabled him to be the only Ethereal that can infuse such massive objects with magic and control them on such a grand scale.

#### Tacitus

Tacitus, Reia's other brother, is an Ethereal that specializes in beasts. We're still gathering more information on him!

#### The Unnamed One

### How were the Ethereals created? <!-- [#ethereal-creation] -->

How the Ethereals were created is still a mystery to most. The only information divulged to occupants and younger Ethereals are that they're created through the <a href="/explore/ethereals#merging">merging</a> or <a href="/explore/ethereals#ascension">ascension</a> of one of the Ethereals.
